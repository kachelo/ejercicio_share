## Star Wars Arc Diagram
=============================================
by [Gaston Sanchez](http://www.gastonsanchez.com/)

**Motivation**
The main idea behind this project is to reproduce, as much as possible, an arc-diagram in R like the one depicted in [Similar Diversity](http://similardiversity.net/) (by Philipp Steinweber and Andreas Koller). 

**Long story short**
I think I saw the arc-diagram of ***Similar Diversity*** for the first time back in 2010. Every time I contemplated that diagram, both amazed and amused, I always ended up wondering how the hell did Philipp and Andreas do it. Finally one day, I couldn't stand my questions anymore so I decided to try to make my own arc-diagram in R... and this project is the result of such attempt. Although I haven't been able to obtain an identical representation of the Similar Diversity arc diagram, I'm really happy with what I got and I guess it's pretty much similar.

**Source**
In my case, I decided to use the movie scripts from the original Star Wars trilogy (episodes IV, V, and VI) as the text data for my analysis. I found the movie scripts at [Ben and Grove](http://www.benandgrover.com/scripts.asp) and [corkey.net](http://corky.net/scripts/) where you can find other scripts if you want to play with other movies.
